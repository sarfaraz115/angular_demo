## Course Description
Learn AngularJS 2, the second edition of the "superheroic" JavaScript framework. Redesigned from the ground up by Google, AngularJS 2 provides advanced features for building single-page applications: declarative templates, two-way data binding, TypeScript support, and dependency injection. And instead of the controllers typical of MVC architecture, AngularJS 2 now offers components. It's a great update, suitable for mobile and web developers alike.

In these tutorials, I show you how to start using AngularJS 2 in your own projects. I start by defining what exactly Angular 2 is and how it differs from AngularJS 1. Then, once the basics are out of the way, he sets up the template that will drive the project and starts coding. I show how to divide your project into modules, work with events, style content with CSS, and create components and subcomponents. Plus, find out how to change content dynamically using data pipes.

The template is included as a free download for all members.
